# _w_pwa

Add any site as a web app, with custom manifest!

## Motivation

The idea for **w_pwa** stemmed from my experience with web browsing on Android. To block ads and improve functionality, I primarily used the Brave browser. While convenient, Brave offered little in terms of UI/UX improvements, lacking features like proper margin colors or a speed dial on the new tab page.

I discovered that websites with a web manifest could be added as app-like shortcuts, providing a clean, minimal experience directly from the home screen. However, these manifests lacked dark mode support. This caused bright splash screens to flash when opening most light-themed websites, leading to eye strain.

To solve this, I explored ways to customize site manifests for a better and more comfortable experience. **w_pwa** is the result of that effort.

## What can we do with this page

- Edit web manifest and save/load
- Update the current page's web manifest directly.
- Generate a javascript code to override some page's manifest.
